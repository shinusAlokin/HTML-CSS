                     The book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury.
                     It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation 
                     under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It won most of the British book 
                     awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top 
                     of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of 
                     that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages 
                     and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. 
                     The novel has sold 
                     in excess of 120 million copies, making it the third best-selling novel of all time.[1][2]
